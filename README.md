XMPPVOX: DOSVOX's XMPP chat client
==================================

XMPPVOX enables visually impaired computer users to communicate with their friends from Google Talk and Facebook using the chat client PAPOVOX, part of [DOSVOX](http://intervox.nce.ufrj.br/dosvox/) system.

## 1. What is XMPPVOX?

XMPPVOX is a chat client that supports the XMPP protocol. This protocol
is used for realtime Internet chat, featuring, among other things, presence
information (a user can be available, busy, unavailable, and so on) and
contact list.

The XMPP protocol is used worldwide. Two existing services that use XMPP to
power their chat systems are Google Talk and Facebook Chat.

XMPPVOX is used through Papovox. Papovox is an existing program, part of DOSVOX, that serves as the frontend user interface, while XMPPVOX translates users interactions with Papovox to suitable XMPP actions.
